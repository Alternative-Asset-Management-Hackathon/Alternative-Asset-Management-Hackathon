# Example Submission

This directory contains an example of a completed submission for the hackathon. Consider this example the 'MVP,' not the explicit blueprint or desired outcome. Participants are welcomed and encouraged to be as creative as possible in the event. 

Please note: each team / individual will be required to submit three things to be elegible for the $1K prize at the completion of the hackathon. 

## A list of the companies identified through the work
 
Just a simple list of the companies found that met the criteria outlined for the hackathon. This can be in any of the following formats:

1. Excel document
2. CSV 
3. TSV
4. TXT

## An explanation of the work performed

This doesn't have to be overly-developed. Just a simple explanation of the steps used to arrive at the list of companies. This explanstion should answer four questions:

1. What did you do? (In a few short sentences)
2. How did you do it? (The full, in-depth explanation)
3. If you had more time to keep working, what would you do next? 
4. If you had it to do over again, what would you have done differently? 

The explanation can be submitted in any of the following formats:

1. Word
2. PowerPoint
3. Markdown
4. TXT
5. HTML
