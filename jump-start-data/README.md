# 'Jump Start' Data Sources

Participants are welcomed and encouraged to use any datasets they find, or create, for this event. That said, if you are just looking to get started quickly, here are some good sources of data that can be used for this Hackathon:

## Data.gov

This site has thousands of useful government datasets. It can be a little difficult to navigate, but there are some interesting finds in here. 

## USASpending.gov

This website has all of the data related to federal spending in the United States. Like data.gov, this can be a generally useful resource. 

## Urban Institute Data Catalog

The urban institute has several open data sets from their researchers and data scientists. There are a lot of different types of data sets in here, mostly about macroeconomic conditions, which could be useful for contextual research.

## CDFI Fund

This website has information about the economic development zones mentioned as one of the search criteria for the event. Of note, they have a simple
spreadsheet which lists all of the states and counties which are designated as "Qualified Opportunity Zones"

## SEC Reg A Database

Has quarterly spreadsheets of each of the companies who have sought > $5 million, but < $50 million in investment

## SEC Reg D Database

Has quarterly spreadsheets of each of the companies who have sought <$5M in debt investment

## SBA.gov

Like data.gov, there are lots of data sources available through the Small Business Administration. They are, however, somewhat difficult to navigate, so this probably shouldn't be the first place to visit.
